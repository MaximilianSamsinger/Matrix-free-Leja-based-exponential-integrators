In this master thesis we develop an algorithm to approximate the action of a matrix exponential function. In particular, we consider the case where the matrix is itself not available, but only its action as a linear operator. The construction is achieved by using a modified version of the real Leja method. We choose optimal interpolation parameters based on a spectral radius estimate computed by the power method. With this procedure we construct exponential Rosenbrock-type integrators to solve stiff advection-diffusion-reaction equations. We compare the performance of these integrators with other matrix-free differential equation solvers.
